# Wadjet

A lightweight analytical query engine in pure Go. Columnar storage on Parquet, vectorized execution, full SQL, and optional distributed processing over NATS and S3-compatible object storage.

## Why Wadjet

- **No coordinator bottleneck** — the coordinator plans queries and schedules tasks but never touches data bytes. Workers read from and write results to object storage directly.
- **Lightweight workers** — viable at 512 MB RAM with spill-to-disk. Scale to zero, start in under 2 seconds.
- **Single binary** — run standalone for development or split into coordinator + workers for production.
- **Pure Go** — no JVM, no CGo, no external query engine dependencies. Custom recursive descent SQL parser, vectorized batch execution, typed kernel dispatch.
- **Network-native types** — first-class IPv4, IPv6, CIDR, MAC, Port, and Protocol column types with 80+ network functions covering CIDR math, deep packet inspection, ICMP analysis, IPv6 tunneling, JA3/JA3S TLS fingerprinting, payload search, and GeoIP/ASN enrichment (MaxMind).
- **Nested types** — ARRAY, ROW/STRUCT, and MAP column types with dot-notation field access, array functions, and full Parquet round-trip.
- **Table functions** — `read_json()`, `read_csv()`, `read_parquet()` query local files and HTTP URLs directly from SQL, with glob patterns and named parameters.
- **GeoIP enrichment** — optional MaxMind GeoLite2/GeoIP2 integration with 11 functions for IP geolocation (country, city, subdivision, coordinates, timezone, continent) and ASN lookup (AS number, organization).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
go build -o wadjet ./cmd/wadjet

# Start standalone (embedded NATS + worker + coordinator)
./wadjet serve --mode=standalone --endpoint=localhost:9000

# Run a query
./wadjet query "SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10"

# Interactive shell
./wadjet shell
```

## Features

### SQL

Full analytical SQL via a custom recursive descent parser:

- SELECT, EXPLAIN, DESCRIBE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE
- CTEs (`WITH ... AS`), UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT (with ALL variants)
- INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS JOINs
- Subqueries: scalar, IN, EXISTS, correlated subqueries
- Window functions with PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, NULLS FIRST/LAST, and ROWS/RANGE frame specs
- GROUP BY, GROUPING SETS, CUBE, ROLLUP, and ORDER BY with positional references
- CASE, CAST, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN, IS NULL/TRUE/FALSE
- Fixed-point DECIMAL(p,s) type with Int128 arithmetic (DuckDB-style scaled integers)
- Nested types: ARRAY, ROW/STRUCT, MAP with `person.name` dot-notation, `element_at()`, `map_keys()`
- Table functions: `read_json()`, `read_csv()`, `read_parquet()` with glob patterns and named parameters
- VECTOR(N) type for embedding storage with cosine_similarity, l2_distance, dot_product, vector_norm, vector_dims
- `embed()` SQL function — OpenAI, Voyage AI, and Ollama embedding providers with batched API calls (one call per record batch) and LRU cache
- 280+ built-in scalar functions (string, math, trig, date/time, network, UUID, conditional, regex, hash, encoding, bitwise, JSON, URL, deep packet inspection, ICMP, IPv6, JA3 fingerprinting, payload search, GeoIP/ASN, vector distance)
- 23 aggregate functions including approx_distinct, corr, covar, percentile_cont/disc, mode, median, min_by/max_by
- User-defined functions (CREATE FUNCTION)

```sql
-- Query JSON files directly from SQL
SELECT ip, count, geoip_country(ip) AS country
FROM read_json('https://example.com/traffic.json')
WHERE count > 100
ORDER BY count DESC

-- Query CSV with custom delimiter
SELECT * FROM read_csv('logs/*.csv', delimiter='|', header=true)

-- Window functions over CTEs
WITH hourly AS (
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) AS hour, SUM(bytes_in) AS bytes
    FROM flow_logs WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT hour, bytes,
       SUM(bytes) OVER (ORDER BY hour ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY bytes DESC) AS traffic_rank
FROM hourly
ORDER BY hour
```

```sql
-- Semantic search with embeddings
SELECT alert_id, description,
       cosine_similarity(embed(description), embed('credential theft')) AS score
FROM alerts
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10

-- Store embeddings in VECTOR columns
CREATE TABLE doc_embeddings (doc_id INT64, embedding VECTOR(1536))
```

### Execution Engine

- **Vectorized** — operators process batches of 2048 rows, not row-at-a-time
- **Push-based pipelines** — Source → UnaryOp → Sink with selection vectors instead of data copying
- **Typed kernels** — type dispatch resolved once at query init, no per-row switches in hot loops
- **3-level pushdown** — partition pruning → row-group stats pruning → row-level filtering
- **Cost-based optimization** — DP join reordering with Selinger-style costing over column statistics (`ANALYZE TABLE`: HLL distinct counts, histograms)
- **Spill-to-disk everywhere** — hash join (grace partition-on-arrival), hash aggregate (partial-state k-way merge), sort and window (external sorted-run merge) all degrade gracefully past memory, governed by a byte-true memory ledger
- **Morsel-driven parallelism** (`--morsel-workers=0`) — intra-task parallel pipeline consumers with bounded, self-draining aggregate partials; opt-in, validated at SF100

### Table Functions

Query files directly from SQL without ingestion:

```sql
SELECT * FROM read_json('data.json')                              -- local file
SELECT * FROM read_json('https://api.example.com/events.json')    -- HTTP/HTTPS
SELECT * FROM read_json('logs/*.json')                            -- glob patterns
SELECT * FROM read_csv('data.csv', delimiter='|', header=false)   -- named parameters
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('warehouse/sales.parquet')             -- Parquet files
```

- **read_json** — JSONL and JSON array auto-detection, schema inference (IPv4, timestamp, bool, numeric), custom direct-to-columnar byte scanner (8x faster than `encoding/json`)
- **read_csv** — configurable delimiter, header detection, type inference
- **read_parquet** — column-at-a-time page reading with row-group stats pruning
- **HTTP filesystem** — connection pooling, Range requests, configurable auth headers
- **Glob patterns** — `read_json('data/*.json')` expands and concatenates matching files

### Storage

- **Apache Parquet** on any S3-compatible store (MinIO, AWS S3, R2, SeaweedFS)
- **Apache Iceberg** metadata reading — register external Iceberg tables and query them via the catalog
- **Hive-style partitioning** with automatic time-based partition keys
- **NATS KV catalog** with revision-based optimistic concurrency
- **Micro-batch ingestion** with configurable flush thresholds (size, row count, time)

### Distributed

- **Stage-DAG execution** — distributed queries run as multi-stage DAGs; every stage output is durable in object storage, giving Trino-style fault-tolerant execution with task retry and worker-death recovery
- **Streaming exchange** (default on) — consumers fetch stage outputs directly from producer workers' local disk over gRPC with asynchronous S3 upload; any failure falls back to the durable S3 path (SF100 suite −23% vs S3-only shuffle)
- **Small-query fast path** — queries under a post-pruning size threshold (default 64 MiB) execute in-process on the coordinator, skipping the DAG entirely
- **Broadcast + probe-split joins** — small builds replicate to all workers; the probe side's files split across workers with coordinator merge
- **Split control/data plane** — NATS for heartbeats, cancellation, and the KV catalog; one multiplexed gRPC stream per worker for task dispatch and results
- **Memory-aware scheduling** — per-task byte estimates bin-packed against live worker pool budgets, with admission gating under memory pressure
- **Graceful worker drain** — SIGTERM stops intake, finishes in-flight tasks, flushes uploads, then exits; Kubernetes-ready with `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `POST /drain`
- **Catalog snapshots** — periodic S3 snapshots of the NATS KV catalog; a rebooted cluster discovers its tables in seconds
- **Federation** across clusters via NATS leaf nodes
- **Embedded NATS** — no external dependencies beyond object storage

### Security

- API key, JWT (HMAC/RSA), and mTLS authentication — enforced on HTTP, pgwire, and gRPC
- RBAC (role-based) and ABAC (attribute-based) access control with deny-overrides combining
- Cell-level policies: column masking, column denial, row filtering via ABAC obligations
- Identity enrichment from JWT claims, mTLS cert fields, and API key attributes
- Hot-reloadable configuration (including ABAC policies)

### Client Connectivity

- **PostgreSQL wire protocol** (pgwire) — connect with `psql`, JDBC, ODBC, or any PostgreSQL client
- **HTTP** REST API for queries, table management, health, and Prometheus metrics
- **gRPC** API with protobuf service definition — generate type-safe clients for Go, Python, Java, TypeScript, Rust, C#, and more
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) — AI agent integration for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools
- gRPC health checking protocol for load balancer integration

### Operations

- Prometheus metrics for queries, scans, workers, cache, and spill
- Kubernetes-compatible probes on every process (`/healthz`, `/readyz`) and graceful worker drain (`SIGTERM` / `POST /drain`)
- Catalog snapshot / restore for fast cluster recovery
- Output in table, JSON, or CSV format

## Benchmarks

### TPC-H SF10 Performance (single node vs DuckDB)

All 22 TPC-H queries at scale factor 10 (~60M lineitem rows, 86.6M total rows across 8 tables). Pure Go, no SIMD, no CGo. Data stored as Parquet on S3 with VPC gateway endpoint.

> Measured 2026-04 (DuckDB v1.2.1). The engine has had substantial
> performance work since (streaming parquet reads, codec pools,
> allocation-free aggregation, external sort/window); treat the table as
> a lower bound on current standalone performance. Distributed-cluster
> performance is tracked separately in the benchmark harness — the suite
> also passes 22/22 with row-count validation at SF100 on a 3-worker
> cluster.

**Standalone** — AWS c7g.4xlarge (16 vCPU Graviton3, 32 GB RAM), S3 storage:

Wadjet wins 18 of 22 queries. Both engines read the same Parquet files from S3 on the same instance. DuckDB v1.2.1 with httpfs + aws extensions. DuckDB times include per-query credential and view setup (~2s overhead each); adjusted total is ~3m41s (Wadjet still 22% faster).

All 22 queries return correct results with validated row counts at SF0.01 (CI) and SF10 (EC2).

```bash
# Reproduce SF0.01 correctness (CI, ~5s)
go test -v -run TestTPCHQueries ./benchmarks/tpch/

# Reproduce SF10 on EC2 (Terraform + SSM, no SSH required)
cd deploy/benchmark/terraform
tofu apply -var="scale_factor=10" -var="worker_instance_type=c7g.4xlarge" \
  -var="data_bucket=wadjet-bench-sf10-use2" -var="generate_data=true"
```

## Deployment Modes

```
wadjet serve --mode=standalone     # All-in-one (dev / small workloads)
wadjet serve --mode=coordinator    # Plans queries, embeds NATS, touches zero data
wadjet serve --mode=worker         # Stateless task executor, scale horizontally
```

## AI Agent Integration (MCP)

Wadjet includes a native [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, enabling AI agents to discover tables, inspect schemas, and execute SQL queries.

```bash
# Start MCP server on stdio (for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor)
wadjet mcp --endpoint localhost:9000
```

Configure in Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wadjet": {
      "command": "wadjet",
      "args": ["mcp", "--endpoint", "localhost:9000"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server exposes 5 tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_tables` | Discover all tables in the catalog |
| `describe_table` | Get schema with column types (including network-native types), nullability, and partition keys |
| `query` | Execute SQL with token-efficient compact JSON output (array-of-arrays, not array-of-objects) |
| `explain` | Show query execution plan without running |
| `list_functions` | List user-defined functions |

AI agents automatically understand network-typed columns (IPv4, CIDR, MAC, Port, Protocol) and receive hints about available network analysis functions.

## Embedding

Use Wadjet as a Go library:

```go
import "github.com/citc-tech/wadjet/wadjet"

db, _ := wadjet.Open(ctx, wadjet.Config{
    StorageEndpoint: "localhost:9000",
    Bucket:          "analytics",
})
defer db.Close()

result, _ := db.Query(ctx, "SELECT src_ip, COUNT(*) FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip LIMIT 10")
```
