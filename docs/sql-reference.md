## SELECT Statement

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] [columns | expressions | aggregates | window_functions]
FROM table_name [alias]
[JOIN other_table [alias] ON condition]
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY columns | positions]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY columns [ASC|DESC] [NULLS FIRST|LAST]]
[LIMIT n [OFFSET m]]
```

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs define named temporary result sets for use in the main query:

```sql
-- Basic CTE
WITH recent_flows AS (
    SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
)
SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total
FROM recent_flows
GROUP BY src_ip

-- Multiple CTEs
WITH
    high_traffic AS (
        SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip HAVING SUM(bytes_in) > 1000000
    ),
    devices AS (
        SELECT ip_address, hostname FROM device_inventory
    )
SELECT d.hostname, h.total
FROM high_traffic h
JOIN devices d ON h.src_ip = d.ip_address

-- CTE with column list
WITH traffic(ip, total_bytes) AS (
    SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip
)
SELECT ip, total_bytes FROM traffic ORDER BY total_bytes DESC LIMIT 10
```

## Set Operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)

Combine results from multiple queries:

```sql
-- UNION: all rows from both sides, deduplicated
SELECT src_ip AS ip FROM flow_logs
UNION
SELECT ip_address AS ip FROM device_inventory

-- UNION ALL: all rows, including duplicates
SELECT src_ip, bytes_in FROM flow_logs WHERE date = '2026-03-14'
UNION ALL
SELECT src_ip, bytes_in FROM flow_logs WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
ORDER BY bytes_in DESC
LIMIT 100

-- INTERSECT: only rows that appear in both sides
SELECT user_id FROM purchases
INTERSECT
SELECT user_id FROM refunds

-- INTERSECT ALL: preserves duplicate counts (min of left/right occurrences)
SELECT user_id FROM purchases
INTERSECT ALL
SELECT user_id FROM refunds

-- EXCEPT: rows from the left side that do not appear in the right side
SELECT src_ip FROM flow_logs
EXCEPT
SELECT ip_address FROM blocklist

-- EXCEPT ALL: each right occurrence removes one left occurrence
SELECT src_ip FROM flow_logs
EXCEPT ALL
SELECT ip_address FROM blocklist
```

All set operations support ORDER BY and LIMIT on the combined result. Operations are left-associative when chained (e.g., `A UNION B EXCEPT C` is `(A UNION B) EXCEPT C`).

## EXPLAIN

View the query plan without executing:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip

-- Verbose plan with more detail
EXPLAIN VERBOSE SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip
```

## DESCRIBE

Inspect a table's schema:

```sql
DESCRIBE flow_logs
-- or
SHOW COLUMNS FROM flow_logs

-- Output: column names, types, nullable
```

## CREATE TABLE

```sql
CREATE TABLE flow_logs (
    src_ip    IPv4 NOT NULL,
    dst_ip    IPv4 NOT NULL,
    src_port  Int32,
    dst_port  Int32,
    bytes_in  Int64,
    timestamp Timestamp NOT NULL
) PARTITION BY (date)
```

## Column Selection

```sql
-- All columns
SELECT * FROM flow_logs

-- Table-qualified wildcard
SELECT f.* FROM flow_logs f

-- Specific columns
SELECT src_ip, dst_ip, bytes_in FROM flow_logs

-- Aliased columns
SELECT src_ip AS source, dst_ip AS destination FROM flow_logs
```

## WHERE Clause

### Comparison Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port = 443
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE bytes_in > 1000000
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE protocol != 'UDP'
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE protocol <> 'UDP'    -- alternate syntax
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE src_port >= 1024
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE bytes_out <= 512
```

### Logical Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port = 443 AND protocol = 'TCP'
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port = 80 OR dst_port = 443
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE NOT (protocol = 'ICMP')
```

### Complex Predicates

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs
WHERE (dst_port = 443 OR dst_port = 8443)
  AND bytes_in > 10000
  AND protocol = 'TCP'
```

### String Matching

```sql
SELECT * FROM syslog WHERE message LIKE '%error%'
SELECT * FROM syslog WHERE hostname LIKE 'fw-%'
SELECT * FROM syslog WHERE message NOT LIKE '%debug%'
```

### NULL Handling

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE src_ip IS NULL
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE src_ip IS NOT NULL
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE active IS TRUE
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE active IS NOT TRUE
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE active IS FALSE
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE active IS NOT FALSE
```

### IN Predicate

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port IN (80, 443, 8080, 8443)
SELECT * FROM syslog WHERE severity IN ('error', 'critical')
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port NOT IN (22, 23)
```

### BETWEEN Predicate

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port BETWEEN 1024 AND 65535
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE bytes_in NOT BETWEEN 0 AND 100
```

### EXISTS Predicate

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs f
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM blocked_ips b WHERE b.ip = f.src_ip)

SELECT * FROM flow_logs f
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM device_inventory d WHERE d.ip_address = f.src_ip)
```

## Subqueries

### Scalar Subqueries

```sql
SELECT src_ip, bytes_in,
       bytes_in - (SELECT AVG(bytes_in) FROM flow_logs) AS diff_from_avg
FROM flow_logs
```

### IN Subqueries

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs
WHERE src_ip IN (SELECT ip_address FROM device_inventory WHERE role = 'server')
```

### Derived Tables

```sql
SELECT t.src_ip, t.total
FROM (
    SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total
    FROM flow_logs
    GROUP BY src_ip
) AS t
WHERE t.total > 1000000
```

## Aggregate Functions

| Function | Description | Null Handling |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `COUNT(*)` | Count all rows | Counts nulls |
| `COUNT(column)` | Count non-null values | Skips nulls |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` | Count distinct non-null values | Skips nulls |
| `SUM(column)` | Sum of values | Skips nulls |
| `MIN(column)` | Minimum value | Skips nulls |
| `MAX(column)` | Maximum value | Skips nulls |
| `AVG(column)` | Average value | Skips nulls |

### Examples

```sql
-- Total traffic by source IP
SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total_bytes, COUNT(*) AS flow_count
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY src_ip
ORDER BY total_bytes DESC
LIMIT 20

-- Count distinct destinations per source
SELECT src_ip, COUNT(DISTINCT dst_ip) AS unique_destinations
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY src_ip

-- Top talkers by destination port
SELECT dst_port, SUM(bytes_in + bytes_out) AS total_traffic
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY dst_port
HAVING SUM(bytes_in + bytes_out) > 1000000
ORDER BY total_traffic DESC
```

## GROUP BY

Groups rows sharing specified column values and applies aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT device, severity, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM syslog
GROUP BY device, severity
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

### Positional References

Use column positions (1-indexed) instead of repeating expressions:

```sql
-- These are equivalent:
SELECT src_ip, dst_port, COUNT(*) FROM flow_logs GROUP BY src_ip, dst_port
SELECT src_ip, dst_port, COUNT(*) FROM flow_logs GROUP BY 1, 2
```

## HAVING

Filters groups after aggregation (whereas WHERE filters rows before aggregation):

```sql
SELECT src_ip, COUNT(*) AS conn_count
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY src_ip
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1000
```

## ORDER BY

```sql
-- Ascending (default)
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY timestamp ASC

-- Descending
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY bytes_in DESC

-- Multi-column sort
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY src_ip ASC, bytes_in DESC

-- Positional references
SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total FROM flow_logs GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC

-- Null ordering
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY src_ip ASC NULLS FIRST
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY bytes_in DESC NULLS LAST
```

## LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
-- First 100 rows
SELECT * FROM flow_logs LIMIT 100

-- Pagination: skip 200, return next 100
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100 OFFSET 200
```

## JOIN

Caelum supports multiple join types using a hash join strategy.

### Inner Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, f.bytes_in, d.hostname, d.location
FROM flow_logs f
JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
WHERE f.bytes_in > 1000000
```

### Left Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, f.bytes_in, d.hostname
FROM flow_logs f
LEFT JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
```

### Right Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, d.hostname, d.location
FROM flow_logs f
RIGHT JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
```

### Full Outer Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, d.hostname
FROM flow_logs f
FULL OUTER JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
```

### Cross Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, p.name AS protocol_name
FROM flow_logs f
CROSS JOIN protocols p
```

The join implementation uses a **hash join** strategy: the right side is loaded into a hash table (build phase), then the left side is probed against it (probe phase). Place the smaller table on the right side of the JOIN for best performance.

## Arithmetic Expressions

```sql
SELECT
    src_ip,
    bytes_in + bytes_out AS total_bytes,
    bytes_in * 8 AS bits_in,
    bytes_in % 1024 AS remainder,
    CAST(bytes_in AS Float64) / CAST(packets AS Float64) AS avg_packet_size
FROM flow_logs
```

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `+` | Addition |
| `-` | Subtraction (binary and unary) |
| `*` | Multiplication |
| `/` | Division |
| `%` | Modulo |
| `\|\|` | String concatenation |

## DISTINCT

Deduplicate result rows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT protocol FROM flow_logs
SELECT DISTINCT src_ip, dst_port FROM flow_logs WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
```

## CASE Expressions

### Searched CASE

```sql
SELECT
    src_ip,
    CASE
        WHEN dst_port = 443 THEN 'HTTPS'
        WHEN dst_port = 80 THEN 'HTTP'
        WHEN dst_port = 22 THEN 'SSH'
        ELSE 'OTHER'
    END AS traffic_type,
    bytes_in
FROM flow_logs
```

### Simple CASE

```sql
SELECT
    src_ip,
    CASE protocol
        WHEN 'TCP' THEN 'Transmission Control'
        WHEN 'UDP' THEN 'User Datagram'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS protocol_name
FROM flow_logs
```

## CAST

```sql
SELECT CAST(dst_port AS Int64) FROM flow_logs
SELECT CAST(bytes_in AS Float64) / CAST(packets AS Float64) AS avg_size FROM flow_logs
```

## Window Functions

Window functions compute values across sets of rows related to the current row without collapsing them into groups.

-- Order with null placement
SELECT
    src_ip, bytes_in,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY bytes_in DESC NULLS LAST) AS rank
FROM flow_logs
```

### Window Frame Specifications

Frame specifications control which rows within the partition are included in the window calculation:

```sql
-- Running sum (all rows from start to current)
SELECT
    timestamp, bytes_in,
    SUM(bytes_in) OVER (
        ORDER BY timestamp
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS running_total
FROM flow_logs

-- Sliding window (3-row moving average)
SELECT
    timestamp, bytes_in,
    AVG(bytes_in) OVER (
        ORDER BY timestamp
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
    ) AS moving_avg
FROM flow_logs

-- Range-based frame
SELECT
    timestamp, bytes_in,
    SUM(bytes_in) OVER (
        ORDER BY timestamp
        RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative
FROM flow_logs
```

Register custom SQL expression functions:

```sql
-- Create a UDF
CREATE FUNCTION classify_port(p) AS
  CASE WHEN p < 1024 THEN 'well-known'
       WHEN p < 49152 THEN 'registered'
       ELSE 'dynamic' END

-- Create or replace
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION classify_port(p) AS
  CASE WHEN p < 1024 THEN 'system'
       WHEN p < 49152 THEN 'registered'
       ELSE 'ephemeral' END

-- Use it in queries
SELECT src_ip, classify_port(dst_port) AS port_class FROM flow_logs

-- List all UDFs
SHOW FUNCTIONS

-- Remove a UDF
DROP FUNCTION classify_port
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS classify_port
```

UDFs can be locked by their owner so only the creator (or an admin) can modify or remove them.
