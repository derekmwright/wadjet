# SQL Reference

Caelum supports a subset of SQL for analytical queries, parsed via the vitess-sqlparser.

## SELECT Statement

```sql
SELECT [columns | expressions | aggregates]
FROM table_name
[JOIN other_table ON condition]
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY columns]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY columns [ASC|DESC]]
[LIMIT n [OFFSET m]]
```

## Column Selection

```sql
-- All columns
SELECT * FROM flow_logs

-- Specific columns
SELECT src_ip, dst_ip, bytes_in FROM flow_logs

-- Aliased columns
SELECT src_ip AS source, dst_ip AS destination FROM flow_logs
```

## WHERE Clause

### Comparison Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port = 443
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE bytes_in > 1000000
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE protocol != 'UDP'
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE src_port >= 1024
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE bytes_out <= 512
```

### Logical Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port = 443 AND protocol = 'TCP'
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE dst_port = 80 OR dst_port = 443
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE NOT (protocol = 'ICMP')
```

### Complex Predicates

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs
WHERE (dst_port = 443 OR dst_port = 8443)
  AND bytes_in > 10000
  AND protocol = 'TCP'
```

### String Matching

```sql
SELECT * FROM syslog WHERE message LIKE '%error%'
SELECT * FROM syslog WHERE hostname LIKE 'fw-%'
```

### NULL Handling

```sql
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE src_ip IS NULL
SELECT * FROM flow_logs WHERE src_ip IS NOT NULL
```

## Aggregate Functions

| Function | Description | Null Handling |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `COUNT(*)` | Count all rows | Counts nulls |
| `COUNT(column)` | Count non-null values | Skips nulls |
| `SUM(column)` | Sum of values | Skips nulls |
| `MIN(column)` | Minimum value | Skips nulls |
| `MAX(column)` | Maximum value | Skips nulls |
| `AVG(column)` | Average value | Skips nulls |

### Examples

```sql
-- Total traffic by source IP
SELECT src_ip, SUM(bytes_in) AS total_bytes, COUNT(*) AS flow_count
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY src_ip
ORDER BY total_bytes DESC
LIMIT 20

-- Average packet size by protocol
SELECT protocol, AVG(bytes_in) AS avg_size, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY protocol

-- Top talkers by destination port
SELECT dst_port, SUM(bytes_in + bytes_out) AS total_traffic
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY dst_port
HAVING SUM(bytes_in + bytes_out) > 1000000
ORDER BY total_traffic DESC
```

## GROUP BY

Groups rows sharing specified column values and applies aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT device, severity, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM syslog
GROUP BY device, severity
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

## HAVING

Filters groups after aggregation (whereas WHERE filters rows before aggregation):

```sql
SELECT src_ip, COUNT(*) AS conn_count
FROM flow_logs
GROUP BY src_ip
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1000
```

## ORDER BY

```sql
-- Ascending (default)
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY timestamp ASC

-- Descending
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY bytes_in DESC

-- Multi-column sort
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY src_ip ASC, bytes_in DESC
```

## LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
-- First 100 rows
SELECT * FROM flow_logs LIMIT 100

-- Pagination: skip 200, return next 100
SELECT * FROM flow_logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100 OFFSET 200
```

## JOIN

Caelum supports inner joins and left joins:

### Inner Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, f.bytes_in, d.hostname, d.location
FROM flow_logs f
JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
WHERE f.bytes_in > 1000000
```

### Left Join

```sql
SELECT f.src_ip, f.bytes_in, d.hostname
FROM flow_logs f
LEFT JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
```

The join implementation uses a **hash join** strategy: the right side is loaded into a hash table (build phase), then the left side is probed against it (probe phase). Place the smaller table on the right side of the JOIN for best performance.

## Arithmetic Expressions

```sql
SELECT
    src_ip,
    bytes_in + bytes_out AS total_bytes,
    bytes_in * 8 AS bits_in,
    CAST(bytes_in AS Float64) / CAST(packets AS Float64) AS avg_packet_size
FROM flow_logs
```

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `+` | Addition |
| `-` | Subtraction |
| `*` | Multiplication |
| `/` | Division |

## Built-in Functions

### String Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `UPPER(s)` | Uppercase | `UPPER(protocol)` → `"TCP"` |
| `LOWER(s)` | Lowercase | `LOWER(hostname)` → `"fw-01"` |
| `SUBSTRING(s, start, len)` | Extract substring | `SUBSTRING(message, 1, 50)` |

### Type Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `CAST(expr AS type)` | Type conversion | `CAST(port AS Int64)` |
| `COALESCE(a, b, ...)` | First non-null value | `COALESCE(hostname, 'unknown')` |

## Query Examples for Network Analytics

### Top Sources by Bandwidth

```sql
SELECT
    src_ip,
    SUM(bytes_in) AS ingress,
    SUM(bytes_out) AS egress,
    SUM(bytes_in + bytes_out) AS total,
    COUNT(*) AS flows
FROM flow_logs
WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
GROUP BY src_ip
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 25
```

### Port Scan Detection

```sql
SELECT
    src_ip,
    COUNT(DISTINCT dst_port) AS unique_ports,
    COUNT(*) AS attempts
FROM flow_logs
WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
  AND bytes_in < 100
  AND protocol = 'TCP'
GROUP BY src_ip
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT dst_port) > 100
ORDER BY unique_ports DESC
```

### Error Rate by Device

```sql
SELECT
    hostname,
    severity,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM syslog
WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
  AND severity IN ('error', 'critical', 'alert', 'emergency')
GROUP BY hostname, severity
ORDER BY count DESC
```

### Traffic by Hour

```sql
SELECT
    CAST(timestamp / 3600000 * 3600000 AS Timestamp) AS hour,
    SUM(bytes_in) AS total_ingress,
    SUM(bytes_out) AS total_egress,
    COUNT(*) AS flow_count
FROM flow_logs
WHERE date = '2026-03-15'
GROUP BY CAST(timestamp / 3600000 * 3600000 AS Timestamp)
ORDER BY hour
```

### Join Flow Data with Device Inventory

```sql
SELECT
    d.hostname,
    d.location,
    d.role,
    SUM(f.bytes_in) AS total_ingress,
    COUNT(*) AS flow_count
FROM flow_logs f
JOIN device_inventory d ON f.src_ip = d.ip_address
WHERE f.date = '2026-03-15'
GROUP BY d.hostname, d.location, d.role
ORDER BY total_ingress DESC
LIMIT 50
```

## Limitations

- No subqueries (yet)
- No window functions (yet)
- No UNION / INTERSECT / EXCEPT
- No CREATE TABLE / INSERT via SQL (use the Go API or Bento for ingestion)
- No UPDATE / DELETE (append-only analytical store)
- String matching limited to `LIKE` (no regex in SQL — use Bento for pre-filtering)
